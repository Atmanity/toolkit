The server makes portraits (`generate_portraits`), enhances or restyles the
creator's photo (`enhance_portrait`) and designs voices (`design_voice`). Each is a paid
call, charged only when results come back. Its price comes from
`get_account`, and the balance only from `get_balance` (SKILL.md rule 12).

## When to offer generation

- **The creator has no portrait or voice** in step 1, which needs both before
  it can create the avatar.
- **A pair is failing** and you've diagnosed which side (the candidates reference).

Don't generate up front "to have options". Don't generate a real person's
likeness from a description, ever (the people-and-publishing reference).

## Before each round of paid calls

1. Read the price from `get_account`: `pricing.generation` has
   `portraitsMicrocredits`, `enhancementsMicrocredits` and
   `voicesMicrocredits`, each divided by 100 for credits; never assume 1.
   Read the balance from `get_balance`: `spendableMicrocredits` / 100.
2. Ask once for the whole round: every paid call the step needs (portraits
   and a voice together, for example), each with its price, then the total
   and the balance: "Make four portraits (<price>) and voice previews
   (<price>), <total> in all? You have <balance> left." With one call, give its
   price and the balance. Wait for a clear yes in the creator's next message;
   it covers only the calls you named. Never split a round into one question
   per call, and never add a call to it after the yes.
3. For each call in the round, make up a new `requestId` (a UUID). Before sending,
   add a pending entry to `paid_calls` in the avatar's latest iteration file
   (the iterations reference; with no file yet, start `000-create.md` now):
   the tool, the date, the `request_id`, the exact `inputs` you will send and
   `status: pending`. In claude.ai, put the pending id and inputs in the chat
   summary instead. Then send the call with that `requestId` and
   `confirm: true`. The server refuses the call without either, so
   `confirm: true` goes only after the yes, never before.
4. If the call times out or returns `request_in_progress` or `rate_limited`,
   wait the seconds it gives (`retryAfter`, or "retry in N s" in its
   message), then send the **same** call again:
   the same `requestId`, the same inputs and `confirm: true`. Don't ask
   again: the same id never charges twice, and a call still running answers
   with its one result once it finishes. Tell the creator in one line that
   it is still being made. A wait of minutes means the charge is still being
   confirmed; the pending entry keeps the id safe if the turn ends first.
5. When the result comes back, mark the entry `status: done` with the
   credits charged (`microcreditsCharged` / 100). On an error that charged
   nothing, mark it `failed`; on the `invalid_input` that says the key was
   already used and charged, mark it `lost` (SKILL.md rule 8).

After each paid result, read `get_balance` again and mention what's left.

**A pending entry left behind** (a Resume, an interrupted turn, or a call
that never answered): before offering any new paid call, send it again with
its `request_id`, its exact `inputs` and `confirm: true`, without asking the
creator again, and handle the result as in step 5. Reuse a `requestId` only
for this retry of identical inputs; any change is a new request with a new id.

A result with `replayed: true` is an earlier result returned again, charged
nothing this time. Before using one of its outputs, check `unavailable`: an
unavailable output was already used or has expired and can't be used.

## How much to spend

Count the avatar's charged paid calls (`done` and `lost`) across its iteration
files. At 10, and every 10 after, stop before the next paid call and ask as a choice (SKILL.md rule 9):
"That's 10 paid generations for Mira so far. Keep going?" with "Keep going"
and "Stop here". On "Keep going", carry on to the next 10. Rule 1 still asks
before each round; this is a check-in on the total.

**On `insufficient_credits`:** say so, give the top-up link from the error's
message (or the billing page on atmee.ai), and stop. Don't retry, and don't
loop asking. **On `api_key_spend_cap_reached`:** the API key's spend cap is
used up; say so and stop the same way.

## Portraits

`generate_portraits` takes a `description` and returns up to four
`portraits`, one per provider. Each has an `upload` (`upload:<uploadId>`), a
short-lived `url` to the full-size image and its `provider`. Each portrait's
small preview arrives as an image after the JSON, labelled
`Portrait N (upload:<uploadId>):`; match each image to its portrait by that
upload, not by position. It is for invented characters only.

**Writing the description:** step 1 has no character yet, so ask one style
question first and build the description from the answer and the name. Put
the free-text hint in the question, not in an option: "What should <name>
look like? Pick a style, or type age, gender, look and style" with the styles
as options (SKILL.md, How to ask the creator).

Don't ask about framing and don't add one of your own: "head and shoulders"
is not required. When the creator asks for a half-body or full-body shot,
or for gestures or movement, write that framing into the description; a v2
avatar moves what the portrait shows.

- Be specific: age, gender, expression, clothing, style, and the framing
  when the creator gave one.
- Keep the face front-facing with the lips slightly parted, and the whole
  figure inside a square: the engine keeps only the centre square. In a full
  body shot the face gets small, so check each option against the portrait
  checks' fifth-of-the-square rule.
- Photorealistic, half-body: "A professional woman in her 30s, navy blazer,
  warm smile, lips slightly parted, half-body from the waist up, hands
  visible, neutral background."
- Stylised, full body: "A friendly cartoon character with big eyes,
  colourful outfit, cheerful expression, standing, full body, facing the
  camera."
- Too vague: "a friendly avatar". Ask the creator what style they want first.

**Judging:** save every option from its `url` with `scripts/media.sh save`
(kind `faces`) and show them with `scripts/media.sh show`, then run the
portrait checks (the portrait-checks reference) on each, generated or
enhanced. Recommend one with reasons, and let the creator pick.

**One change to a chosen portrait.** When the creator likes a generated
portrait but wants one thing different ("lighter background", "close the
collar"), generate again with that change written into the same description.
It is a new paid call, asked first. Keep the earlier options beside the new
ones, and let the creator pick which to use.

## Enhancing or restyling the creator's photo

`enhance_portrait` takes `image`, the creator's photo as it is, and returns
up to four square versions the same way as portraits. If the photo shows a
real person other than the creator, rule 4 applies first.

- **Without `prompt`** it enhances: use it when a real photo is close but
  flawed (poor lighting, odd crop, low resolution).
- **With `prompt`** it restyles: the same person in a new look, scene or
  style ("as a 1920s detective, film noir lighting", "in a chef's whites in
  a bright kitchen", "as a watercolour painting"). Offer it when the creator
  has a photo and wants a different look for that person, instead of
  describing a stranger with `generate_portraits`. The person is kept unless
  the prompt asks otherwise, so write any change to the person itself (age,
  hair, a cartoon animal) into the prompt on purpose. Up to 2,000
  characters. A blank prompt only enhances.

A restyle costs the same as an enhancement and is moderated like any input:
on `moderation_flagged`, rephrase the prompt with the creator and use a new
`requestId`. A changed prompt always needs a new `requestId`.

Pass the photo as `upload:<uploadId>`: upload the `sources/` copy with
`create_upload` (kind `portrait`, SKILL.md, Files and uploads) just before the
call, or pass a public https link the creator gave. Enhancing doesn't use the
upload up, so if the creator picks the original after all, pass the same
`upload:<uploadId>` to the create, within its hour.

**Is it still the same person?** Before recommending an enhanced or
restyled portrait, compare it with the original: face shape, features, skin
tone, apparent age and hair. Ignore what the prompt asked to change (a
restyle that was asked to age them is supposed to look older). If anything
else changed enough that someone who knows them would notice, say so plainly
("this one doesn't look like the same person: the jaw and eyes changed") and
don't recommend it. Offer to try again or to use the original.

A restyle may also leave the face turned away, covered or too small, or no
longer a face at all; run the portrait checks on each option as for any
portrait, and say which ones won't talk well.

## Voices

`design_voice` takes `voiceDescription` (20 to 1,000 characters), the
avatar's `language` and its name (`avatarName`), and returns `voices`. Step 1
has no character yet, so ask the creator how the voice should sound (age,
warmth, pace) and build the description from that.

**Writing the description:** "<Gender>, <age>. Persona: <2–5 words>.
Emotion: <2–3 adjectives>. <1–2 sentences about timbre, pacing, delivery>."
For example: "Female, 30–35. Persona: warm friendly guide. Emotion:
welcoming, cheerful. Smooth, natural timbre with gentle intonation and a
moderate pace." Ask for an expressive, energetic delivery: it animates better.

**Writing the sample text (`sampleText`):** three or four sentences the
avatar would say to a visitor, in its language, drawn from what the creator
has said so far, so the creator hears a person rather than a generic
greeting. Keep it within these lengths (220–600 characters for Latin and
Cyrillic scripts, 120–300 for Chinese, Japanese and Korean, 180–450 for
Hindi): that is what makes the sample run 10–60 seconds. No real person's
name. Without `sampleText`, the server writes the sample itself.

**Judging:** you can't hear audio. Save each preview from its `url` with
`scripts/media.sh save` (kind `voices`) and show it with `scripts/media.sh
show`, so the creator can play it. Each preview comes with:
- `durationSeconds`: every preview the server returns runs 10–60 seconds;
  `null` means the provider didn't report the length
- `spokenText`, the text it actually speaks, and its `provider`
- a `url` the creator plays

Say plainly that the creator judges how it sounds, then ask them to listen
and choose. Mention a preview whose length is unknown as such. If none
suits the creator, offer one new design at the stated price, with a changed
description or `sampleText`: a "slower delivery" in the description doesn't
make the sample longer.

## Using generated outputs

Pass the chosen output's `upload` as it is: a portrait as `assets.image.url`
to `create_avatar` or as `url` to `replace_appearance`, a voice as
`assets.voice.url` to `create_avatar` or as `url` to `replace_voice`. Never
download it and upload it again. Each works for one avatar and expires 24
hours after it was made: after that, or for a second avatar, generate again
(a new paid call, asked first). Its `url` expires sooner, so save the copy
you show as soon as the result comes back.
