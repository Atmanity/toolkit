# Atmee: the product map

You know what Atmee is, what each part of it does and how it is paid for, so
you can answer a question about the product and steer an idea to the right
**path** before anything is built. This file holds what changes slowly: what
exists and how it fits together. Numbers change often (prices, plan limits,
the balance), so they always come from a **live source** (Pricing, below),
never from this file or from memory.

## What Atmee is

Atmee (atmee.ai) makes **live video avatars**: a face, a voice, a
personality and knowledge that hold a real-time spoken conversation with a
person over video, lips in sync. In the website's words: build your own live
video avatars, with any voice, personality and knowledge, then launch them on
Atmee or integrate them anywhere. People make avatars of themselves (a
digital twin), a brand's concierge, an expert, a teacher, a companion, a
historical figure or an original character.

The company was called Atmanity, and the name stays in infrastructure: the
API host (`api.atmanity.us`), the GitHub organisation
and some ids. In anything a person reads, say Atmee.

## The surfaces

| Surface | For | What happens there | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| **atmee.ai** | people who talk to avatars | explore avatars, visit creators' profiles, talk to an avatar from its share link | `https://www.atmee.ai` |
| **Atmee Studio** | creators, no code | make and edit v1 avatars, set visibility, share, analytics, API keys (Studio → API & Embeds), plans, top-ups, sponsoring and earnings (Studio → Billing) | `https://www.atmee.ai/studio`, signed in |
| **Avatar API** | developers | put an avatar in their own product: start conversations from their backend, create and manage avatars and keys | docs `https://www.atmee.ai/docs/api` |
| **Agent tooling** | anyone working through an agent | the skills `create-avatar`, `plan-avatar-app`, `build-avatar-app`, `atmee-setup` and this one, the avatars server (with generation), the `atmee` CLI | the atmee plugin |

What each surface offers in detail: `references/features.md`.

## Website pages

When the user asks for a page on the website, give the link the avatars
server returns, never one you build: an avatar's `links` (`get_avatar`,
`list_avatars`, `atmee avatars get --json`) are `chat`, `profile` and
`studio`; `get_account`'s `links` are `explore`, `avatars`, `create`,
`billing`, `apiKeys`, `analytics` and `docs`. For a link to talk to an
avatar, give `links.chat` from `get_avatar`: it carries the avatar's
language.

Only when a response has no `links` (a server that predates them), build
the link: `https://<host><path>`, where `<host>` is `www.atmee.ai`; never an
API host, which serves no website pages.

| They ask for | Path |
|---|---|
| a link to talk to an avatar | `/avatars/<avatar id>?lang=<language>` |
| its public profile | `/avatars/<avatar id>/profile` |
| editing it in Studio | `/studio/avatars/<avatar id>/edit` |
| Explore | `/studio/explore` |
| their avatars | `/studio/manage` |
| making an avatar in Studio | `/studio/create` |
| credits, plan, top-ups, earnings | `/studio/billing` |
| API keys | `/studio/api-keys` |
| analytics | `/studio/analytics` |
| a creator's page | `/@<handle>` |
| the API docs | `/docs/api` |

`?lang=` is the avatar's language, so the call is in it. A private avatar's
pages open only for its owner, signed in. A link to talk to an avatar is
always its chat page: never start a session for it (`start_session`,
`session chat --open`) unless the user asks for a LiveKit room by name.

## Ideas worth knowing

- **An avatar** is a portrait, a voice (cloned from a sample), a persona
  (who it is, what it does with the visitor, greeting, guardrails, names) and optional knowledge
  files. It speaks one language; a session can ask for another.
- **Two engines.** v1 animates a talking head from one portrait: sharp and
  cheaper, and the engine the public API docs describe. v2 adds emotion,
  expression and motion; it is invite-only for now. An account gets it from
  an invite code (the agent redeems it with `redeem_code`, `atmee redeem CODE`
  in a terminal, or Creator Studio's Billing page) or an email invite
  (waitlist: `https://www.atmee.ai/v2signup`); `get_account`'s `v2Access`
  says whether it has it. A v2 avatar is captured several times;
  each capture is a **seed** (the server says candidate or take, and the
  API's `seed` field is an informational number, not the clip) and the
  creator picks the one that serves. Studio, the Avatar API and the agent
  tooling (`create-avatar`) build v2 for an account that has it, and v1 for
  any account.
- **Visibility:** private, unlisted (anyone with the link) or public (listed
  on atmee.ai). Through the API an avatar starts private or unlisted and
  goes public by an update once it is ready.
- **Status:** building, then ready, or failed, or `moderation_hold` (a person
  reviews it; never retry). Talk only when `readyToChat` is true.
- **Credits** pay for everything: conversations by the minute, generation
  per call. The API counts microcredits: divide by 100 for credits.
- **Monetized and sponsored are opposites,** never one setting. A
  **monetized** (Signature) avatar charges the visitor a higher per-minute
  rate on atmee.ai and the creator earns a share. A **sponsored** avatar lets
  visitors talk on the creator's credits from its sponsor pool, and earns
  nothing. An avatar can't be both. Rates come from `get_account`, never
  from memory (`references/pricing.md`).
- **An avatar can talk without being spoken to.** An app makes it remark on
  something with an `event`, an agenda's steps carry it on by itself, and it
  speaks up after a silence. Don't tell anyone it needs the user to speak
  first, or claim limits these files don't state: say you'll check, and read
  `build-avatar-app`'s limits.
- **One conversation at a time per avatar,** one user in it. More users at
  once need more avatars.
- **The conversation runtime.** v2 conversations on the plugin's servers run on Causeur,
  which gives apps their controls: room messages (`state`, `event`, typed
  turns), app tools (the avatar calls the app) and agendas (a conductor graph
  of steps). A session the older behavior module runs accepts tools and
  never calls them.

## Which path fits

Match the idea to a row, name the path in one line, then hand over to the
last column.

| They want | Path | Then |
|---|---|---|
| An avatar people can talk to: themselves, a brand, a character | Studio for a v1 avatar on atmee.ai; for v2 (early access), the avatars server | Studio needs no agent; `create-avatar` for v2 |
| A talking avatar in their website or app, with Atmee running the conversation | **Session API**: their backend starts the session, their page joins the LiveKit room (there is no embeddable widget) | `build-avatar-app` |
| The avatar to act on their app: turn a slide, look up an order, keep score | Session API with **app tools** | `build-avatar-app` |
| A conversation with steps: an interview, a lesson, an onboarding | Session API with an **agenda** | `build-avatar-app` |
| A face for a voice agent they already run on LiveKit Agents | **Render path**: `livekit-plugins-atmee`, or the API's avatar sessions; a portrait-only avatar is enough | `https://www.atmee.ai/docs/livekit-plugin/livekit-agents-plugin` |
| Visitors talking free on the owner's credits | a **sponsor** pool on the avatar | Studio → Billing, or the CLI's sponsor commands with a key |
| An avatar live in front of an audience: a stream, a webinar | the broadcast-host shape on the Session API, restreamed (Current limits) | `build-avatar-app` |
| To earn from their avatar | the verified creator program on atmee.ai | Studio; nothing to build (`references/pricing.md`, Earnings) |
| A portrait or a voice they don't have | the avatars server's generation tools, paid per call | `create-avatar` |
| To manage avatars from code or CI | the Avatar API or the `atmee` CLI | `docs/cli.md` in the GitHub repo `Atmanity/toolkit` |

Proven app shapes, the sample apps that proved them, and what they taught:
`references/use-cases.md`.

## Current limits

Say up front when an idea needs what Atmee does not do yet, with the closest
path that works:

- **An audience** watching one conversation: one user token per session, no
  viewer tokens; a broadcast restreams the avatar's video. atmee.ai's own
  live streaming is not open to everyone.
- **Long sessions:** the plan caps a session's length; longer use chains
  sessions, with a visible cut.
- **A different persona per session:** the persona belongs to the avatar;
  per-app behaviour comes from `state` and the agenda, or another avatar.
- **Eyes through the API:** the app runs its own vision model and sends what
  it sees as `state` and `event`.
- **A transcript from the server:** the room's captions are the record; the
  app keeps them if it needs one.
- **Built but not open to everyone:** live streams and the avatar profile
  page on atmee.ai, mini-apps and apps inside a call, and voice design in
  Studio (the generation server has it). Name these as coming, never promise
  them; `references/features.md` marks each where its surface is described.

`build-avatar-app`'s "Current limits" has the full list for builders.

## Pricing

Prices and plans change: quote them only from a live source, with the date
you read them.

- **Plans and credit packs:** Studio → Billing,
  `https://www.atmee.ai/studio/billing` (sign-in needed). There is no public
  pricing page; `/pricing` sends visitors to sign in.
- **API costs, public:** `https://www.atmee.ai/docs/api/overview#costs`:
  credits per minute for the Session API and for the render path, what a
  credit costs depending on how it is bought, and what the Free plan allows
  through the API.
- **The account in hand,** from the avatars server: `get_account` (`atmee
  account`) for the plan, its `limits` and per-minute `pricing`;
  `get_balance` (`atmee balance`) for what is spendable now. Each generation
  tool's price is in `get_account` under `pricing.generation`.

Credits, buckets, what costs what, spend caps, sponsoring and earnings:
`references/pricing.md`.

## Rules

1. **Real people.** An avatar may be the creator or someone who authorised
   them, and the creator keeps a record of that consent (Terms of Use). Their
   own photo and voice sample are fine once permission is confirmed; never
   generate a real person's face or design a voice to sound like them.
2. **Restricted content** (`https://www.atmee.ai/terms-of-use`): hate,
   sexual content, anything involving minors, graphic violence, extremism,
   illegal activity, defamation, unauthorised endorsements, dangerous
   behaviour such as self-harm, and medical, legal or financial advice. An
   avatar in health, law or money informs and points to a professional.
3. **Public only on request,** after the creator approves the title,
   description and tags.
